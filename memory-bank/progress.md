# Progress: AgentRulesHub

## What Works
1. Core Data Models Implementation:
   - AgentRule model with language and tags support ✅
   - Abstract RuleSource base class ✅
   - FileSource implementation for YAML files ✅

## Project Evolution
### Phase 1: Data Model Foundation
- Created initial project structure ✅
- Implemented core models ✅
- Set up memory bank documentation ✅

### Phase 2: Implementation (Pending)
- [ ] YAML parsing integration
- [ ] Rule retrieval logic
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Example rule files
- [ ] Loading mechanism

### Phase 3: Future Enhancements (Planned)
- [ ] Additional source types
- [ ] Rule validation
- [ ] Advanced filtering capabilities
- [ ] Performance optimizations

## Known Issues
- None at current stage (initial implementation)

## Current Status
- Base data models implemented
- Ready for YAML integration
- Documentation complete

## Project Decisions
1. Initial Decisions:
   - Use of abstract source pattern ✅
   - YAML as file format ✅
   - Nullable language support ✅
   - Tag-based categorization ✅

2. Pending Decisions:
   - YAML parsing library selection
   - Rule validation strategy
   - Performance optimization approaches
